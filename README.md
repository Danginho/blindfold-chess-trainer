# Blindfold Chess Trainer

This is a personal project where I plan to implement the following features:

Play blindfold chess to varying levels of difficulty:
- Easy: Board is shown but pieces are invisible, available moves are shown, move history is shown, most recent move is shown
- Medium: No board, available moves are shown, move history is shown, most recent move is shown
- Hard: Only available moves + most recent move is shown 
- Advanced: Only the most recent move is shown (simulates actual blindfold chess)

Another badass feature would be using an AI that helps you evaluate positions, but that would be a huge task so probably won't happen
